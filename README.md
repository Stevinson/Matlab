# Computation Project
## Wireless Communication Channels: Characterisation Using Orthogonal Functions

Project which investigates the statistical properties of WiFi systems. Uses a set of othogonal basis functions to construct a 
mathematical model of the pdf describing the attenuation caused by scattering.

The project writeup is stored in ProjectReport.pdf.
